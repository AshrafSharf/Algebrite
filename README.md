# Intro

Algebrite is a Javascript library for symbolic mathematics (actually, mostly coffeescript resulting in Javascript) keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

# Why Algebrite

Algebrite is...
* lightweight: made to be simple to comprehend and extend, it only depends on BigInteger.js by Peter Olson.
* self-contained: doesn't need connection to servers or another "backend" CAS
* a library: beyond use as an interactive tool, Algebrite can be embedded in your applications and extended with custom functions.
* free: MIT-Licenced

# Features
Algebrite supports: arbitrary-precision arithmetic, complex quantities, simplification, expansion , substitution, units of measurement, derivatives and gradients, tensors, integrals, multi-integrals, computing integrals and much more!
